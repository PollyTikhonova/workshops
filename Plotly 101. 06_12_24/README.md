### Agenda
### Goal
The main goal of this workshop is to learn, how we can use plotly library, to construct various types of plots and perform initial descriptive analysis.

### Datasets
Department of Buildings (DoB) complaints dataset. The main dataset we use for the analysis, stored at the NYC Open Data Database (link).
NYC Zip Codes. A dataset with geographical coordinates of zip code area boundaries, used for the complaints mapping, stored at the NYC Open Data Database (link)

### Plotly examples covered in this workshop:
- Maps
- Interactive plots
- Bar plots
- Line plots
- Scatter (marker) plots
- Boxplots

### Plots modifications and saving:
- Save in .html format
- Save in .jpg/png format
- Combining different types of plots
- Modifying plots hover descriptions
- Changing colors/line types and other visual parameters
  
### Libraries, requiered by this notebook:
```pip install pandas os urllib json plotly datetime itertools sodapy sklearn geopandas requests zipfile io kaleido```
